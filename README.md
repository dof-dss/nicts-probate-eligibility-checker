### Why did we build this project?

We built this to streamline the probate process.

### What problem was it solving?

This solves the problem of working out if citizens can apply for probate online in Northern Ireland.

This is a simple dotnet core application with the questions hard coded into the site.

### Future plans

This site will be used for a variety of other projects not just Probate. It will be used as an entry point to check eligibility for a certain government service.
